            <p class=""><i>Session cookies</i></br>Session cookies are temporary cookies that allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted. </p>
